# The Swirl Project

![Swirl Mascot, Messier Spiral Galaxy M74, also known as NGC 628][swirl_m74_small]

Swirl is an implementation of the IETF [PPSP] protocol, `RFC7574` in
Erlang/OTP, and released under the [ALv2] license. It is currently incomplete.

Until the project's `alpha` status is removed, expect this repo to change
quickly and without respecting any version numbers. Bugs are expected, but
any reports or even patches would make my day/week/year.

## Requirements

- A modern UNIX system, although `swirl` will likely run on Windows, the
    compile-time dependencies are more complicated. Please contact the
    project if you want to build or run on Windows.
- The most recent release of `Erlang/OTP` available. This is `OTP 18.0` at
    time of writing, and is available from [ESL] for most platforms. This
    is strongly advised, instead of using a possibly inconsistent version from
    your OS packaging system. Swirl will work with `OTP 17.x` but performance
    will not be as good.
- A reasonable level of Erlang and PPSPP knowledge is anticipated.
- If you are developing on / with `swirl` you will need a pre-built dialyzer
    plt. If you don't know what this is, just run `make distclean plt` each
    time you install/upgrade to a new Erlang/OTP release.

## Usage

- Use `make` as usual. It will retrieve dependencies, so internet is needed
  at least for the first run.
- After building, a stand-alone command, `./swirl` starts a simple peer
    on `localhost:7777`, without console access.
- `make console` loads the full erlang application but you'll need to enter
  either `swirl:start_peer().` for a single instance, or read the
  console help via `swirl:help().` to see how to start multiple peers.

## Developers

- `make distcheck` cleans all build files out, compiles, and runs all tests,
  including common_test, and dialyzer.
- `make reindent` uses vim to ensure your indentation is consistent.
- more information is available in [contributing.md]

## Example Usage

From a clean git checkout of `git://github.com/skunkwerks/swirl`,
just run, supplying your root hash:

    make all console
    # erlang console is automatically launched
    swirl:start("c89800bfc82ed01ed6e3bfd5408c51274491f7d4").
    swirl:quit().

This peer should now be active, and able to participate in PPSPP swarms.

Here's what a sample session looks like from the above commands:

```
ðŸŒˆ  dch@akai % git clone git://github.com/skunkwerks/swirl && cd swirl
ðŸŒˆ  dch@akai % make console
